# Memory Card Game

## Description

This project is an interactive memory card game built with React. Players click on cards and attempt to match pairs of cards based on the images shown. The illustrations are made by me.

## Features

- Randomly shuffled cards each game.
- Visual indicators for matched cards.

## Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-card-game.git

   ```

2. **Go to the directory**

   ```bash
   cd memory-card-game
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the app on the server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Simply start the game and click on a card to see the image. Try to find another card with the same image. If both cards match, they will remain flipped. If they don't, they will flip back over. The goal is to match all pairs.
